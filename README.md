# 🎥 Video Upload Platform (Next.js Learning Project)

A modern **video uploading and viewing platform** built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **NextAuth**, and **ImageKit**.  
This project was created **purely for learning purposes** to understand how real-world applications are structured using **Next.js App Router** and modern tools.

## 🚀 Project Purpose

This project is **not just another CRUD app**.  
It is built to deeply understand:

- How **Next.js App Router** works
- How **Client & Server Components** interact
- How authentication works using **NextAuth**
- How to handle **secure media uploads** using **ImageKit**
- How **TypeScript** improves reliability and developer experience
